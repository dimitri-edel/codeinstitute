## Content
All the articles were written by me. I did some research on Bruce Lee and put down the things I had learned about this person. 
Finding images that are not copyrighted was a piece of work. Most images of this person are copyrighted and thus out of the question.
## Testing
### LIGHTHOUSE
Didn't have enough time to straighten out all issues with performance. Most of them come down to using third party resources such as fontawsome and google fonts. 
Also, I used a lazy technique for sizing most of the images by using the auto value for either the height or the width of a given image. I was going to get that taken
care of if I had enough time.

The facts that I used low resolution images for one of the icons takes away some score from the Best Practices.
### Bugs
A few minor bugs came up at the first test. But all of them were typos and were fixed immediately.
During the second test, I encountered an issue. When scrolling down the page some of the elements would slide over the menu bar, making the menu bar appear transparent.
I fixed the issue by applying the z-index property to the elements in question.
### Validator Testing
The pages have been tested by validator.w3.org and jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator and have passed the tests.
## Deployment
The site has been deployed from GitHub. The way to do that was to go to the settings. Click on the Pages icon. Select the repository and the branch. And click on Publish. And that was that.
