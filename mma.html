                Back in the day, most martial arts were rigid in their ways. Styles that were abiding
                by their tradition. Bruce Lee did not like styles. He said and I quote. "My style is to
                have no style." He would go and study a number of martial arts and take from them only
                the things that worked for him. More so, he would adopt the principles of something and
                build on that, adding something of his own. For instance, the best punchers are most certainly
                boxers. The best kicking techniques you will find in Muay Thai , Kung-Fu and Karate. The
                best take downs and grapling techniques in wrestling, Judo and brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. So,
                Bruce's philosophy was to take a bit from all of them, chiseling away things that don't work
                in a real fight. Then take what's left test it to see if it works for you. Then take the
                things that work for you and alter them so they perfectly align with you won physique.
                And last but not least, feel free to have ideas of your own.
            </p>

            <p>
                His ideas ispired many martial artists to experiment and mix different martial arts together.
                And this paved the way to founding a whole new sport: Mixed Martial Arts or MMA for short.

                <h2>In conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    To those who say Bruce was no good as a martial artist, I say that the best way to judge
                    somone is to look at who they fraternize with. And it's no secret that Bruce's best friends
                    were world class athlets and even a few world chamions among them. Those were the people he
                    trained and sparred with.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To those who say that Bruce Lee was some kind of superhuman, I say that Bruce Lee was a human
                    being just like you and I. He became as good as he was through hard work and training and
                    keeping an open mind. So can you, if you set your mind to it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I was a child I always wanted to be like someone else. And it was a different character
                    every week at that. But at some point I pinpointed my own traits and abilities that form the
                    foundation of my own self. The things I've learned from other people are the stilts that
                    hold up the structure that we call personality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    when I think of bruce i don't see a star. Neither do I put him on a pedestal. Bruce doubtlessly was
                    an
                    inpiring idividual. Yet the world is teaming with people, who are just like him in many ways.
                    We grow up around people, who diplay traits that feel useful to be adopted by ourselfs.
                    The most important thing to take from Bruce is to be true to yourself and strive to become the
                    best version of yourself you can be. Learn from people who you feel a connection with on
                    some level.

            </header>



            <p>
                Jeet Kune Do is a collection of techniques hand picked by Bruce Lee for his own use. The name
                tranlated means <em>Way of the Intercepting Fist</em>. He has written several books that cover
                techniques and principles. One of them is called <a href="books.html#book-of-jeet-kune-do"
                    target="_blank">Tao of Jeet Kune Do</a>.
                The other one covers his Fighting Methods and it is also called <a href="books.html#book-BLFM"
                    target="_blank">Bruce Lee's Fighting Methods</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Here is what Bruce Lee said about Jeet Kune Do:
            </p>




            <p>
                I have not invented a <q>new style</q>, composite, modified or otherwise that is set within distinct
                form
                as apart from <q>this</q> method or <q>that</q> method. On the contrary, I hope to free my followers
                from
                clinging to styles, patterns, or molds. Remember that Jeet Kune Do is merely a name used, a mirror
                in
                which
                to see <q>ourselves</q>. . . Jeet Kune Do is not an organized institution that one can be a member
                of.
                Either you understand or you don't, and that is that. There is no mystery about my style. My
                movements
                are simple,
                direct, and non-classical. The extraordinary part of it lies in its simplicity. Every movement in
                Jeet
                Kune Do is being
                so of itself. There is nothing artificial about it. I always believe that the easy way is the right
                way.
                Jeet Kune Do is
                simply the direct expression of one's feelings with the minimum of movements and energy. The closer
                to
                the true way of Kung Fu,
                the less wastage of expression there is. Finally, a Jeet Kune Do man who says Jeet Kune Do is
                exclusively Jeet Kune Do is
                simply not with it. He is still hung up on his self-closing resistance, in this case, anchored down
                to a
                reactionary pattern,
                and naturally is still bound by another modified pattern and can move within its limits. He has not
                digested the simple fact
                that truth exists outside all molds; pattern and awareness is never exclusive. Again let me remind
                you
                Jeet Kune Do is
                just a name used, a boat to get one across, and once across it is to be discarded and not to be
                carried
                on one's back.
            </p>
            <h2>Adapt what is useful, reject what is useless, and add what is specifically your own</h2>
            <p>
                Bruce incorporated <em>footwork and punching</em> techniques from <em>western boxing</em>. He
                adopted
                some footwork from the
                legendary heavy weight boxing champion <em>Mohamad Ali</em>. Some of the footwork came from
                <em>fencing</em>. He took
                some <em>kicking</em> techniques from <em>Muay Thai</em> and <em>Kung-Fu</em>. Other elements such
                as
                <em>Grappling and Trapping</em> came
                from <em>Jiu-Jitsu</em>. First of all Bruce tryed to cover all aspects of hand to hand combat
                punching,
                kicking, trapping and grappling.
                Yet, the point of all that was to learn what other people had learned so far and adopt the things
                that
                worked from his point of view.
                He would take the principles and create his own techniques based on them.
