            <h1>Impact on Martial Arts</h1>
            <p>
                Back in the day, most martial arts were rigid in their ways. Styles that were abiding
                by their tradition. Bruce Lee did not like styles. He said and I quote. "My style is to
                have no style." He would go and study a number of martial arts and take from them only
                the things that worked for him. More so, he would adopt the principles of something and
                build on that, adding something of his own. For instance, the best punchers are most certainly
                boxers. The best kicking techniques you will find in Muay Thai , Kung-Fu and Karate. The
                best take downs and grapling techniques in wrestling, Judo and brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. So,
                Bruce's philosophy was to take a bit from all of them, chiseling away things that don't work
                in a real fight. Then take what's left test it to see if it works for you. Then take the
                things that work for you and alter them so they perfectly align with you won physique.
                And last but not least, feel free to have ideas of your own.
            </p>

            <p>
                His ideas ispired many martial artists to experiment and mix different martial arts together.
                And this paved the way to founding a whole new sport: Mixed Martial Arts or MMA for short.
            </p>

            <h2>In conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                To those who say Bruce was no good as a martial artist, I say that the best way to judge
                somone is to look at who they fraternize with. And it's no secret that Bruce's best friends
                were world class athlets and even a few world chamions among them. Those were the people he
                trained and sparred with.
            </p>

            <p>
                To those who say that Bruce Lee was some kind of superhuman, I say that Bruce Lee was a human
                being just like you and I. He became as good as he was through hard work and training and
                keeping an open mind. So can you, if you set your mind to it.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I was a child I always wanted to be like someone else. And it was a different character
                every week at that. But at some point I pinpointed my own traits and abilities that form the
                foundation of my own self. The things I've learned from other people are the stilts that
                hold up the structure that we call personality.
            </p>
            <p>
                when I think of bruce i don't see a star. Neither do I put him on a pedestal. Bruce doubtlessly was an
                inpiring idividual. Yet the world is teaming with people, who are just like him in many ways.
                We grow up around people, who diplay traits that feel useful to be adopted by ourselfs.
                The most important thing to take from Bruce is to be true to yourself and strive to become the
                best version of yourself you can be. Learn from people who you feel a connection with on
                some level.
