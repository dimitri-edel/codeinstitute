                Bruce Lee dreamed of becoming a famous actor in Hollywood. It took him long enough but he got there
                eventually.
                Bruce also made a name for himself in the world of martial arts. His impact on the world of martial arts
                was huge.
                Because of his aproach to hand-to-hand combat a whole new breed of martial art sprang up some 20 years
                after
                his death. Bruce introduced the idea of Mixed Martial Arts and layed the foundation for the sport.
                Nowadays,
                many clubs exist that allow fighters from varoous backgrounds to compete with one another. The first and
                most
                famous of these clubs is probably the UFC.

                            teapot,
                            it becomes the teapot. Water can flow, or it can crash. Be water, my friend!</q>

                            Don’t fear failure. Not failure, but low aim, is the crime. In great attempts it is glorious
