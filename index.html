                        <q>Empty your mind. Be formless. Shapeless. Like water. You put water into a cup,
                            it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle. You put it in a
                            teapot,
                            it becomes the teapot. Water can flow, or it can crash. Be water, my friend!</q>

                            Don’t fear failure. Not failure, but low aim, is the crime. In great attempts it is glorious
                            even to fail.
