                    Bruce was born in San-Fransisco, CA, USA in 1940. He grew up in British Hong-Kong and started
                    actiong at
                    a very young age.
                    Bruce also took up martial arts and dancing classes as an adolescent. At the age of 18, being an
                    American citizen, he moved from Hong-Kong to
                    the US. He enrolled at the University of Washington To make money he started a martial arts school
                    in
                    Seatle, WA.
                </p>

                    Bruce Lee dreamed of becoming a famous actor in Hollywood. It took him long enough but he got there
                    eventually.
                    Bruce also made a name for himself in the world of martial arts. His impact on the world of martial
                    arts
                    was huge.
                    Because of his aproach to hand-to-hand combat a whole new breed of martial art sprang up some 20
                    years
                    after
                    his death. Bruce introduced the idea of Mixed Martial Arts and layed the foundation for the sport.
                    Nowadays,
                    many clubs exist that allow fighters from varoous backgrounds to compete with one another. The first
                    and
                    most
                    famous of these clubs is probably the UFC.

        <article>
            <h2>Philosophy</h2>
            <p>
                Bruce studied Taoism since he was a teenager. Taoism at its core is about maintaining balance.
            </p>
            <p>
                His insights and inferences are universal. We all know that if you swerve too far into the negative
                poeple will reject you. And if you swerve too far into the positive people will take advantage of you.
                Even in Mathematics, the <b>Game Theory</b> states that the best way to go is to open up with a
                cooperative
                move and then mirror the actions of your opponent. Which one could translate to being kind and
                respectful
                to people when you meet them. If they react with the same kindness and repect you just do the same. Yet
                if
                they start beeing disrespectful then one should act accordingly. I am not suggesting that one should
                stoop
                to their level. On the contrary, there are many ways to remain polite and still comand respect. The only
                thing
                one should not do is keep pampering someone even though they are being clearly inconsiderate and rude.
                Bruce once said:<q>I am not in this world to live up to your expectations and you are not in this world
                    to live
                    up to mine.</q>
                In predicaments of that nature you need to correct the trajectory of the interaction towards something
                positive. Try to find common ground and build on that. This is the ideo of beeing centered. It requires
                a certain level of self-awareness. Staying calm but ready to spring into action if necessary.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another angle of his philosophy is to strive for flexibility. For there is one certainty in life that
                things will change.
                And if you fail to react to the changes in your environment you will be left behind. For instance, in
                competition
                is it necessary to keep close tabs on one&apos;s rivals. And if they change their tactics or strategy,
                so should you
                if you do not yet have a counterstrategy. Undeniably all relevant changes in the world require us to
                change.
                And I believe this is one way of regarding his famous quote <q>Be like Water!</q>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another angle of his philosophy is to learn from anyone and anything if you consider it useful. Build on
                that
                knowledge and get creative with it. But also reject anything that does not agree with you. And again
                this requires
                a high level of self awareness.

                    <q>Empty your mind. Be formless. Shapeless. Like water. You put water into a cup,
                        it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle. You put it in a
                        teapot,
                        it becomes the teapot. Water can flow, or it can crash. Be water, my friend!</q>
